Front End Test for printed.com

I built the HTML page based on the given design.

Firstly I took all elements/layers from PSD file by using Photoshop. 
Some of the icons hasn't been provided, but I found them in an open source website Iconfinder.com

I used HTML5 tags/elements to build the structure of the page.

I was showing my skills and knowledge in CSS by adding the styles.
Straight from beggining I applied box-sizing and clearfix, to simplify my work.
As you can see in my code there is plenty of comments, which makes the code clean, and helps other people (and me) to read code better.

Even if this test doesn't require adding any behaviour to the page, I added bit of JavaScript to show future possibilities.
