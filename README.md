Front End Test for printed.com

Was build on the base of the graphic.

Firstly I took all elements/layers from graphic by using Photoshop. 
Some of the icons hasn't been provided, but there were plenty in open source websites. My choice was Iconfinder.com

In this project I used html5 tags/elements, build the structure of the page.

To style I was showing my skills and knowledge in CSS.
Straight from beggining I applied box-sizing and clearfix, to simplify my work.
Styles which can be applied to the whole page, goes first, and after by the order, Header, Main Content and Footer.
It is makes code readable and simplify future refactoring, if it needs, or adding styles for new features.
As you can see in my code there is plenty of comments, which is great for the same reasons, and helps to other people (and me) to read code.

I find developer tools build in the browser very useful, and use it a lot, but there is plenty great tools online, which was very handy for box-shadowing (http://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow).

Even if this test doesn't require adding any behaviour to the page, I added bit of JavaScript to show future possibilities.
